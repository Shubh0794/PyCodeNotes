Best way to learn a language : Practice
  - Solve Small problems (like competitive programming / Project Euler)
        Increases speed / Command on your language concepts / Makes you think about complexity / Keeps you in touch of various concepts.
  - Take up a project ( Can be something you want to build : web crawler / Machine learning application / web application .. and more )
        Gets you deeper into concepts
        Boosts your project handling capabilities
  - Read others code
        Opens up your mind to other ways to approach a problem.
